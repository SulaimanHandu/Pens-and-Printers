{"cells":[{"source":"# Pens and Printers Sales Report \n### **Company Overview**\n\nFounded in 1984, Pens and Printers is a trusted provider of high-quality office products, ranging from pens and notebooks to desks, chairs, and monitors. As consumer purchasing behaviors evolve, so must our sales tactics. Launching a new product line is a significant investment, and it’s crucial to employ the most effective strategies to ensure success.\n\n### **Data Preparation**\n\nWe received data from the sales team to analyse our sales performance, which was extracted from their tracking system. This data will serve as the foundation for our analysis, guided by the information provided in the metadata. Our first step was to validate and clean the data using Power BI.\n\n### **Data Validation**\n\n![Meta Data](image.png)\n\nAfter importing the CSV file into Power BI, we used Power Query to perform data validation and cleaning. Below are the key observations and actions taken:\n1.\tWeek Data: The week data was correctly represented, requiring no changes.\n2.\tSales Method: Some inconsistencies were found in the Sales_method values. We corrected these to ensure the column contains only three distinct, valid values.\n \n \n![profile view](Screenshot%202024-08-22%20232223.png)\n![Replacement](Screenshot%202024-08-16%20181052.png)\n\n3.\tCustomer_id field was confirmed to be unique, and the data type was correctly set.\n4.\tNb_sold column was converted to an integer data type for accuracy.\n5.\tRevenue: We identified null values in the Revenue column. These were replaced with the average revenue of their respective categories.\n6.\tYears_as_customers column was left as categorical since it shows the tenure of the customers as a categorical field. \n7.\tNb_site_visits column was also changed to a numeric data type.\n8.\tState: The State column was already in the correct data type and was clean.\n\nWith these steps completed, our data validation process is now finalized and ready for analysis.\n\n### **Data Analysis**\n\nA pilot was conducted with 15,000 customers to evaluate the effectiveness of various sales methods. Among the methods tested, email alone reached the highest number of customers, while the combination of email and calls engaged the fewest. The chart below provides a detailed breakdown.  \n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-23 002119](Screenshot%202024-08-23%20002119.png)\n\n\n### **Revenue Insights**\n\nThe total revenue generated from this pilot was approximately 1.31 million. As anticipated, the email-only method produced the highest revenue, correlating with the larger customer base engaged through this channel. However, despite reaching fewer customers, the email and call combination outperformed the calling-only method, generating 80% more revenue. This highlights the effectiveness of the combined approach.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-23 004050](Screenshot%202024-08-23%20004050.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-23 000056](Screenshot%202024-08-23%20000056.png)\n\n### **Performance Over Time**\n\nThe pilot spanned six weeks, during which the different sales methods exhibited varied performance. The calling method maintained a relatively constant sales rate across all weeks, while the email method saw a strong initial response in the first week, followed by a steady decline. On the other hand, the email and call combination started slow but showed significant improvement over time, indicating its potential as a long-term strategy.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-23 011001](Screenshot%202024-08-23%20011001.png)\n\n \n### **Customer Engagement and Revenue Per Customer**\n\nTo account for the varying customer numbers across methods, we analyzed the average revenue per customer. The results revealed that the email and call combination was significantly more effective, generating 77% more revenue per customer than email alone and 246% more than calls alone.\n \n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-23 004707](Screenshot%202024-08-23%20004707.png)\n\n\n### **Customer Tenure and Purchase Behavior**\n\nCustomers were categorized based on their tenure with us. The analysis suggests that newer customers are more likely to purchase products than older customers, as indicated by a right-skewed distribution.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-23 005709](Screenshot%202024-08-23%20005709.png)\n \n### **Site Visits and Product Sales**\n\nWhen comparing the total number of site visits and products sold across customer categories, we observed consistent behavior. Customers who received both calls and emails visited the site more frequently, reinforcing the effectiveness of the combined sales approach.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-23 011433](Screenshot%202024-08-23%20011433.png)\n\n### **Monitoring Business Performance with Metric**\n\nTo effectively address the business problem, it is essential to focus on \n- key metrics such as customer engagement, revenue per customer, conversion rates, and customer retention. \n- Regularly monitor these metrics through weekly reviews and comprehensive monthly reports. Utilize the insights gained to fine-tune sales strategies, allocate resources more effectively, and tailor marketing efforts to different customer segments. \n- Emphasize continuous improvement by implementing feedback loops and conducting A/B testing to refine tactics and adapt to evolving market conditions. This approach ensures that sales methods are consistently optimized to drive maximum revenue growth and business success.\n\nTo estimate the total revenue projection for the 15,000 customers based on the average revenue of 159 per customer from the Email + Call method, you can use the following calculation:\n\n1. **Average Revenue per Customer (Email + Call)**: 159\n2. **Total Number of Customers**: 15,000\n\n**Total Revenue Projection** = Average Revenue per Customer × Total Number of Customers\n\nSo, the projected total revenue for 15,000 customers, based on the average revenue of 159 per customer from the Email + Call method over the same period of time, would be 2,385,000. This is about 77% increase in revenue compared to what we have in the current data. \n \n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis reveals that while email alone reached the most customers and generated the highest overall revenue, the combination of email and calls proved to be the most effective method in terms of revenue per customer. Despite initially slow performance, the combined approach showed significant improvement over time, suggesting its potential as a powerful long-term sales strategy. Additionally, the analysis highlighted that newer customers are more inclined to purchase products, emphasizing the need to tailor our marketing efforts based on customer tenure. Overall, the combined method of email and calls emerged as the most promising tactic for driving sustained revenue growth.\n\n### **Recommendation**\n\nBased on the analysis and the nature of each sales method, I recommend prioritizing the Email + Call approach for future sales campaigns. While the Email-only method requires minimal effort, it lacks the personalized touch that can drive higher engagement. The Call-only method is resource-intensive, with sales team members spending significant time per customer, yet it doesn't yield the highest revenue.\nThe Email + Call method strikes a balance by leveraging the efficiency of email communication and the effectiveness of personalized follow-up calls. The 10-minute calls in this approach are more time-efficient than the 30-minute calls used in the Call-only method, yet they still provide valuable customer interaction. This method not only generated significantly higher revenue per customer but also showed increasing effectiveness over time, making it a strong long-term strategy. By adopting the Email and Call approach, Pens and Printers can maximize revenue while optimizing the use of sales team resources.\n\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"c22f7f5b-2a69-4515-8b29-7b0e94829f11","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
